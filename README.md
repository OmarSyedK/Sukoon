## 📖 Problem Statement

> In 1963, Betty Friedan described motherhood as *“The Problem That Has No Name.”*  
> Even today, 1 in 5 mothers faces anxiety or depression—and 75% go untreated. Despite family and social media, many feel socially isolated, which is now considered more dangerous than smoking or obesity.
